#### Goals for this Module


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - More ideas for the game
- **Challenges faced**:
  - na
- **Solutions**:
  - na

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  Making it so there are less variables thought up on the fly so they can be hard coded into the game instead of a system of entering stuff

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I made a system where eveything in the inventory would do a specific thing so i cna just code a few of those instead of the endless stuff i hade before while keeping it interesting
-  this translated to the physical prototype as cards for every item that says their effect instead of an abstract inventory

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Start coding the bade gameboard and movement
