#### Goals for this Module

- [V] make characters fun to design
- [ ] Balance movement
- [ ] Find a game engine


#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  
  -I thougth up some ideas, I want the game to be a boardgame but still feel movement based and have 2 or 3 different character types competing for a common goal
- **Challenges faced**:
 
  - Just thinking how to balance excessive movement in a board game setting.
- **Solutions**:
- Different movement types can debuff how much you move fromt he dice roll after you exit the special movement

#### Learnings
- All the talk of balance this week got me concerned. I feel it would be easy to accidentaly make something better than another thing and not notice until you have to fix it.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.


- How can I balance movement types by messing with the movement system and the attibutes of each class.
  


#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Look at more game engines and see what would be suitable and do the math for how big the board should be.
