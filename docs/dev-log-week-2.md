<!-- Repeat the below as needed-->
### Date: [02/08/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
<!-- Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [V] make characters fun to design
- [ ] Balance movement
- [ ] Find a game engine
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - <!--I thougth up some ideas, I want the game to be a boardgame but still feel movement based and have 2 or 3 different character types competing for a common goal-->
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  <!--Just thinking how to balance excessive movement in a board game setting.-->
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  <!--Different movement types can debuff how much you move fromt he dice roll after you exit the special movement-->

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  <!--All the talk of balance this week got me concerned. I feel it would be easy to accidentaly make something better than another thing and not notice until you have to fix it.-->

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
<!--

- How can I balance movement types by messing with the movement system and the attibutes of each class.
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  <!--Look at more game engines and see what would be suitable and do the math for how big the board should be.-->
